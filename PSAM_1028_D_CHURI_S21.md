## Course Description
CD Foundations: Interaction is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative mediumâ€”as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a learning-through-making approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed. This course is intended for non-communication design majors, as an introduction to the discipline.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.
1. Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great design concepts)
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design, using incremental methods such as prototyping, user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.
1. Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding.
1. Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including responsive websites and apps for mobile.
1. Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to inter- active systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and create consistency.
1. Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize your own work.
1. Be able to archive and document work that is printed, on screen or time based in a reflective manner for learning portfolio.
1. Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet.
1. Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems, particularly systems for dealing with unpredictable, variable, and ever-changing content.

## Assessable Tasks
#### Recipe
A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something. Create a web page showing a recipe. Your recipe should not be a recipe for food. You could give instructions for performing a ritual, creating an object or a process. Your recipe must contain the following items:

- Title
- Main image
- Preparation time
- Amount of servings
- Description
- Unordered list of at least five ingredients
- Ordered list of at least five steps
- At least one image

Keep the following in mind:
- Clean code
- Correct use of HTML codes
- Use Paragraph and Div tags to divide up different types of information.

    This assignment is designed to begin the process of familiarizing students with the development environment as well as basic HTML. Understanding how to properly organize files and the use of a plain text editor will be required. Additionally, students will have to research how to add an image to their HTML. This assignment will begin the process of understanding programming concepts and researching unfamiliar technical topics.

#### Recipe Style
Use the concepts we learned in class to add styling to your recipe. Please keep in mind the difference in purpose between HTML and CSS. Do not leave aspects of your design to the web browsers default settings. Take care to ensure careful use of type and hierarchy in your work.
Make design decisions regarding:
- Body copy size and spacing
- Header size and spacing
- Paragraphs

- Text styling such as bold, italic, links, etc.

<!-- #### Hypertext Narrative -->
<!-- Create a hypertext narrative using image and text that allows the user to create their own _choose your own adventure_ style story. Use at least 6 interconnect pages to allow the reader to progress to multiple potential endings. Each page should allow the user to make a decision that changes the course of the narrative. -->

<!-- #### Lasers & Feelings -->
<!-- Lasers & Feelings in an example of a one-page role playing game. Many people -->
<!-- have "hacked" the game to make it their own. Create a webpage that is your hack -->
<!-- of Lasers and feelings. Change the name of the game and some of the copy to give -->
<!-- it your own flavor.  -->

<!-- Produce a website no more than one or two screens tall that contains all of the rules -->
<!-- to play your version of Lasers & Feelings. -->

<!-- - [Lasers & Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/) -->
<!-- - [Muppet Babies RPG](http://origamigaming.com/index.php/2017/07/30/muppet-babies-rpg/)  -->
<!-- - [Facts & Innuendos](http://ashgamedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/facts-innuendosv1.0.pdf) -->
<!-- - [Pisskids and Ratbags](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/212258/Pisskids-and-Ratbags) -->

#### Style Guide
Create a _Style Guide_ that can be used as a tool for making design decisions. Similar to a _type specimen_, this style guide shows how type can be used on the web. Using the provided examples as a guide, create an HTML/CSS document that shows a variety of layouts of body copy, justification styles, paragraphs, and headlines. Include a color palette, use of images and forms. Create two documents. One using a serif typeface and one for sans-serif.


<!--     The careful use of type is one of the challenges of a design education. The development of a personal style guide allows an artist or designer to develop a relationship with the presentation of type without a concern for content.   -->

#### Recipe Style 2
Edit your reipe document to use the material we covered in class.
- Padding and margins
- Columns
- Flexbox


#### Circle Triangle Square
Create a page 3 screens tall. Each screen has a circle, an equilateral triangle,
and a square in a horizontal row. Choose a yellow, a red, and a blue to color
each shape a different color. Using only those three colors, assign the shapes a
different color on each screen. Change only the color of the shapes on each screen
and then adjust the spacing.

In each screen:

- the three shapes appear to be centered
- the three shapes appear to be the same distance apart
- the tree shapes appear to be on the same baseline

#### Responsive Recipe
Edit your recipe to be viewed across three different screen sizes.

#### Bestiary Page
Create a webpage that is a single page of a
[bestiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestiary). Choose or create a
[fictitious creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulder) for the subject matter and consider using content based on a
[real creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae).

<!-- #### Tyger Tyger -->
<!-- Create a webpage 4 or more screens tall. On each of the 4 screens use type, -->
<!-- image, similarity, proximity, continuance, scale, texture, tone, color (black -->
<!-- and only one other color) to experiment with symmetry. Please come prepared to -->
<!-- explain your chosen use of symmetry and the design principles used to achieve it. -->

<!-- #### Illuminated Manuscript vs. The Machine -->
<!-- In the reading _Working With Style_ we examined the difference between modern -->
<!-- and classical page layout. Using an excerpt of your favorite short story or -->
<!-- essay, create two different layouts. One in a classical style and the other -->
<!-- modern. Use the same HTML code for both styles. -->

<!-- Bonus Points: Use a single HTML file but change between modern and classical based -->
<!-- on screen size or other event. -->

<!-- #### Type Specimen -->
<!-- Recreate Ellen Lupton's _Type Spec Demo_ as a web page. You may ignore the red -->
<!-- notes. Choose a typeface you wish to explore and create a web version of a type -->
<!-- specimen. Create a responsive web page beginning with the mobile version. -->

<!-- #### Broadside -->
<!-- #### Responsive Recipe -->
<!-- Using the recipe you created early, redesign the layout for accessibility and for viewing on multiple devices. Test your design for desktop, tablet, phone, touch and mouse. -->

<!-- This assignment adds another level of complexity to the _Recipe_ assignment. Students will become comfortable separating the meaning and intent of their work from its presentation. We will also talk about presenting to a diverse audience with differing needs. -->

<!-- #### Old Master Study -->
<!-- Choose a painting to be the subject of a composition study. Recreate the composition with code using basic shapes, lines, and colors. Display your work on a webpage with an image of the original work. Include information identifying the original work. -->

<!--     In this version of a standard art school assignment, students use code to explore the composition of the work of an old master. Students will have to use code to create and layer shapes but be limited in their expression by the requirement to replicate the composition of an older work. -->

<!-- #### Patterns -->
<!-- Create a webpage showing a series of 4 different patterns generated with code. -->

<!-- Code excels at repetition. Choose four words (e.g. winter, spring, summer, fall). Use variables and loops to generate a series of four patterns which illustrate those patterns. Display the patterns on a webpage. Each pattern should be labeled with its word. -->


<!-- Pattern making is a satisfying codemaking exercise that introduces students to the power programming. Students will present their code in class and work with their classmates to solve problems.  -->


<!-- #### Forking Paths -->
<!-- Create an interactive narrative. Allow your user choose their path through the experience and allow their decisions to affect the narrative programmatically. Use images, sound, video and type. Consider alternate forms of user input. -->


<!-- Students will have to research the programming concepts they wish to use. They will require creative thinking to create the experiences they wish to present. They will be required to use a variety of media elements. Students will work together to troubleshoot their code. -->

#### Final Project: Student's choice
Create a web site of your choosing for the final project. You proposal must be approved.

<!-- #### Final Project: FUTURE PRODUCT -->
<!-- Create *Product Page*, a page introducing a consumer product. Invent a product for you page that satisfies a future need. Ask yourself *how could society change in the future*. What needs will these changes bring and what product could satisfy those needs. The final project will be divided over 3 milestones and each will be graded individually. Students may submit an alternate final project of their choosing for approval. -->

The final project is designed to give the students the freedom to be creative and explore the aspects of the course that interests them while providing a structured framework that is of their own design.
##### Final Project Proposal
Create a simple presentation pitching your final project to the class. Include a description of the project, an outline of the process you will use to complete it, and what you hope to achieve by presenting your work to the public.
<!-- #### UX Documentation & Development Plan -->
<!-- Turn in a PDF of the UX documentation for the final project. Include a site map and user journey. Also turn in a development accounting for a three week development period. Be specific about what you intend to have completed at each milestone. -->

### FTP ( File Transfer Protocol )
You should have received access to a folder on the newschool servers from IT services. If not you will need to get that information from them. Inside this folder (also known as a directory) is another folder named *public_html*. This folder is viewable online at the address you have received.

To access this folder and upload your site:
Option 1: Use Cyberduck or other FTP program.
- Download an FTP program like Cyberduck.
- Set the mode to SFTP
- Input the correct name, password, and port number.
You can now upload files and folders.

Option 2: Use the Terminal
- Open the application _Terminal_ on your computer.
- Navigate to the folder containing your site's folder using the *cd* command. example: cd Documents/school/creative\ computing/mySiteFolder
- You can check the contents of this folder with *ls* (list). The folder containing your site should be in this list of files and folders.
- Next you will access the remote folder with _sftp_. Type the following into the terminal and press return.
    sftp -P 222 yourUserName@b.parsons.edu.
- After entering your password you will be in the remote server. *ls* to list the contents of a folder. *cd public_html* to move into that folder.
- Now create a folder to hold your site by typing _mkdir yourSiteFoler_
- Move into the folder you created with _cd yourSiteFoler_
- Now you can use the *put* command. *put -R mySiteFolder. Your site is now online. and available at the http://b.parsons.edu/~yourUserName/yourSiteFolderi*
